        <p>Water on Earth is incredibly old. The water in your glass today
          may have once rained down on an ancient volcano, been frozen for
          thousands of years in a glacier, or even been slurped out of a puddle
          by a thirsty dinosaur!</p>

        <p>How is that possible?</p>

        <p>Water on Earth doesn’t disappear—it’s always on the move.
          It travels through a continuous journey called <strong>the water cycle</strong>,
          powered by energy from the Sun.</p>

        <p>In this article, you’ll explore how water moves through the world, and build a model of the water cycle along
          the way.</p>

        <h2>Goin’ Up!</h2>
        <p>Ever been caught in the rain? Those drops soaking your shirt might have
          once been part of a puddle, a lake, or even the ocean. But how did they
          get all the way up into the sky?</p>

        <p>Water makes that trip through a process called <strong>evaporation</strong>.</p>

        <p>When sunlight warms the surface of a pond, puddle, or ocean, it gives
          some water molecules enough energy to break free and escape into the air
          as invisible water vapor. If the air around them is dry enough, those
          tiny bits of water can drift upward, rising higher and higher into the
          atmosphere.</p>

        <h2>A Little Help From Plants</h2>
        <p>Plants can also help move water from Earth’s surface into the sky.
          Plants can even move water from beneath the surface with the help of
          a process called <strong>transpiration</strong>. Transpiration is
          similar to evaporation, but it happens when plants release water vapor
          through tiny openings in their leaves, called stomata.</p>
        <p>Water travels from the plant’s roots into the leaves, and as the Sun
          warms the leaves, the water evaporates from the stomata and
          escapes into the air. This helps to cool the plant and pull more water
          and important nutrients into the plant.</p>
        <p>Water vapor from plant transpiration is an important part of the
          water cycle. In fact, plants release far more water vapor into the air
          than animals do. In a single day, a large tree can release
          hundreds of liters of water vapor into the atmosphere!

        <h2>Chilling Out</h2>
        <p>Now that we know that water moves from Earth’s surface into the
          atmosphere, imagine what would happen if that water just kept rising
          and rising. Eventually, all of the water would be gone from Earth’s
          surface!</p>
        <p>Fortunately for all of us, <b>condensation</b> plays a part in the
          water cycle. Think of condensation as the opposite of evaporation.
          As warm water vapor rises, the molecules lose heat energy to the cold
          air high in the atmosphere. As they lose energy, they slow down and
          can more easily clump together, forming tiny water droplets. When these
          droplets combine with tiny particles of dust or salt in the air, they
          can form clouds.</p>
